Project- Card Details of the Thoth Tarot - 
> [may later, calculation on cards belongs to Birthday]

## Overview

The Thoth Tarot card deck has 78 cards. This page is about the "major arcana" - which means 22 cards of the hole deck. On click you will get
a picture of each card, meaning, symbols, affirmation. In "History" some information about the person behind.

## Details

To build an information overview of this tarot card deck, was an old project of mine. I tried to program it once on "Filemaker" in the end of the 90th.
This is for people who are interested in symbolism, numerology and mystical things.

## Time

- Estimated ~15 hours 10 days.
- Actual (add this on project completion)

## New skills

I try to get more experience with content shown by css and not 'hide' inside html. Also move the content into screen with transition / transform.

## Challenges + lessons learned

I need more experience with flexbox, position and display.

## Achievements

Make a scribble before and keep in mind, what the page have to do. Then make a plan. Begin on what you know and only mark, where you need additional information.

## Buddy sign-off

(get together with your buddy, check each other's logs for completeness, talk through your projects as a pair. Include their name here once you're finished.)
